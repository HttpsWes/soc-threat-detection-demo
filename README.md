# SOC Threat Detection Demo

This project is a mini Security Operations Center (SOC) threat detection tool built in Python. 
It simulates how SOC analysts monitor logs, detect suspicious activity, correlate threat intelligence,
and generate alerts and reports.

## Features
- Event loggings and parsing
- Brute-force login detection
- Unauthorized User login detection
- After-hours access detection
- Alert generation and reporting
- Intel Threat matching

## Why This Project
I built this project to better understand the day-to-day responsibilities of a SOC analyst, including
log analysis, alert triage, and proactive threat hunting. 

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- CSV log files
- Basic threat intelligence lists

## Future Improvements
- Real-time log ingestion
- SIEM integration
- Automated response actions
- More detection rules
